# Learning Trip – 100 Mini Projects in .NET & C#

Welcome to **Learning Trip**, a long-term educational journey where I build **100 mini projects** to learn, practice, and master **.NET** and **C#** from the ground up.

This repository is designed for:
- Beginners who want to start with .NET and C#
- Students looking for practical examples
- Developers who want hands-on practice through real mini-projects
- Anyone who learns best by building real things

## 🎯 Project Goal
Create **100 small, focused, practical projects** that cover:

- C# basics → variables, loops, OOP, LINQ  
- .NET fundamentals → APIs, MVC, minimal APIs  
- Databases → EF Core, SQL  
- Real-world scenarios → authentication, logging, deployment  
- Tools & ecosystems → Swagger, Git, testing  
- Step-by-step progression from beginner → intermediate → advanced  

Each project is small but complete, with:
- Source code  
- Explanation  
- Learning outcomes  
- How to run the project
